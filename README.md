# ft_irc

IRC chat made based on the RFC 1459 standards. This server was made mainly to work in accordence with the HexChat client.

# Personal Notes

This was a group(3) project.

I contributed to the connection, command handling, method developing and polling file descriptors parts. We used SOLID standarts for this project.
We had an interface for commands. 

I used the RFC as reference and handled commands according to the standarts.

In the end, we had a fully working IRC client. As a team we had lots of time to test and discuss how to develop the server. We decided on having an interface
in order to have a reusable and editable code.
